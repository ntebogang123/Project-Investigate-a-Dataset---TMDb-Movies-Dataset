Project Summary:

**Project Overview:**
This project involves the analysis of a cleaned TMDb movie dataset using Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. The goal is to explore the data, ask relevant questions, and communicate the findings effectively.

**Installation Requirements:**
To execute the project, Python, along with the following libraries, is required:
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- csv

Anaconda is recommended for installation, as it provides all the necessary packages and an IPython notebook environment.

**Objective:**
The project aims to guide through the entire data analysis process, utilizing Python libraries for a comprehensive understanding. The acquired skills in data analysis, problem investigation, and data wrangling contribute to valuable insights, aligning with sought-after skills in the job market.

**Learning Outcomes:**
Upon completion, the project ensures the understanding of the typical data analysis process. Key takeaways include the ability to pose questions, investigate and wrangle data effectively, and communicate findings. Proficiency in using NumPy and pandas for vectorized operations, along with Matplotlib for visualizations, is gained.

**Project Details:**
- Dataset: TMDb movie data containing information on 10,000 movies, including user ratings and revenue, cleaned from the original Kaggle data.
- Key Focus: The analysis addresses questions related to genre popularity over time and identifies properties associated with high-revenue movies.

**Execution:**
The project involves conducting a data analysis using pandas and NumPy, presenting the findings in a Jupyter file, and generating an HTML report. While inferential statistics or machine learning are not mandatory, the project emphasizes the tentative nature of the findings.

**Resources:**
The project draws on external resources, including pandas documentation, GeeksforGeeks, and a GitHub repository, for additional guidance and solutions.

**Project Contribution:**
The analysis covers genre popularity trends, factors associated with high revenues, and ensures clear communication of results. The project is open-ended, promoting flexibility in exploring and presenting findings.
